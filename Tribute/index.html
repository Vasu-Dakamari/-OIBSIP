			<h2>A brief summary of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj journey</h2>
			<h3>Early life</h3>
			<p>
				Shivaji was born in the hill-fort of Shivneri, near the city of Junnar, which is now in Pune district.
				Scholars disagree on his date of birth. The Government of Maharashtra lists 19 February as a holiday
				commemorating Shivaji's birth (Shivaji Jayanti). Shivaji was named after a local deity, the
				goddess Shivai. Shivaji's father Shahaji Bhonsle was a Maratha general who served the Deccan
				Sultanates. His mother was Jijabai the daughter of Lakhuji Jadhavrao of Sindhkhed, a Mughal-aligned
				sardar claiming descent from a Yadav royal family of Devagiri.

				Shivaji belonged to Maratha family of Bhonsle clan. His paternal grandfather Maloji (1552–1597) was
				an influential general of Ahmadnagar Sultanate, and was awarded the epithet of "Raja". He was given
				deshmukhi rights of Pune, Supe, Chakan and Indapur for military expenses. He was also given Fort
				Shivneri for his family's residence (c. 1590).

				At the time of Shivaji's birth, power in the Deccan was shared by three Islamic sultanates: Bijapur,
				Ahmednagar, and Golkonda. Shahaji often changed his loyalty between the Nizamshahi of Ahmadnagar, the
				Adilshah of Bijapur and the Mughals, but always kept his jagir (fiefdom) at Pune and his small army.
			</p>
			<h3>Background and context</h3>
			<p>
				In 1636, the Adil Shahi sultanate of Bijapur invaded the kingdoms to its south. The sultanate had
				recently become a tributary state of the Mughal empire. It was being helped by Shahaji, who at
				the time was a chieftain in the Maratha uplands of western India. Shahaji was looking for opportunities
				of rewards of jagir land in the conquered territories, the taxes on which he could collect as an
				annuity.

				Shahaji was a rebel from brief Mughal service. Shahaji's campaigns against the Mughals, supported by the
				Bijapur government, were generally unsuccessful. He was constantly pursued by the Mughal army and
				Shivaji and his mother Jijabai had to move from fort to fort.
				In 1636, Shahaji joined in the service of Bijapur and obtained Poona as a grant. Shivaji and Jijabai
				settled in Poona. Shahaji, being deployed in Bangalore by the Bijapuri ruler Adilshah, appointed Dadoji
				Kondadeo as administrator. Kondadeo died in 1647 and Shivaji took over the administration. One of his
				first acts directly challenged the Bijapuri government.
			</p>
			<h3>Conflict with Bijapur sultanate</h3>
			<p>
				In 1646, 16-year-old Shivaji took the Torna Fort, taking advantage of the confusion prevailing in the
				Bijapur court due to the ailment of Sultan Mohammed Adil Shah, and seized the large treasure he found
				there. In the following two years, Shivaji took several important forts near Pune, including
				Purandar, Kondhana and Chakan. Also, he brought areas east of Pune around Supa, Baramati, and Indapur
				under his direct control. He used the treasure found at Torna to build a new fort named Rajgad.That fort
				served as the seat of his government for over a decade. After this, Shivaji turned west to the
				Konkan and took possession of the important town of Kalyan. Bijapur government took note of these
				happenings and sought to take action. On 25 July 1648, Shahaji was imprisoned by a fellow Maratha sardar
				called, Baji Ghorpade under the orders of Bijapur government, in a bid to contain Shivaji.

				Shahaji was released in 1649 after the capture of Jinji secured Adilshah's position in Karnataka. During
				the period of 1649–1655 Shivaji paused in his conquests and quietly consolidated his gains.
				Following his father's release, Shivaji resumed raiding, and in 1656, under controversial circumstances,
				killed Chandrarao More, a fellow Maratha feudatory of Bijapur, and seized the valley of Javali, near the
				present-day hill station of Mahabaleshwar, from him. In addition to the Bhonsale and the More
				families, many others including Sawant of Sawantwadi, Ghorpade of Mudhol, Nimbalkar of Phaltan, Shirke,
				Mane and Mohite also served Adilshahi of Bijapur, many with Deshmukhi rights. Shivaji adopted different
				strategies to subdue these powerful families such as forming marital alliances, dealing directly with
				village Patils to bypass the Deshmukhs, or subduing them by force. Shahaji in his later years had an
				ambivalent attitude to his son, and disavowed his rebellious activities. He told the Bijapuris to do
				whatever they wanted with Shivaji. Shahaji died around 1664–1665 in a hunting accident.

			<h3>Coronation</h3>
			<p>
				Shivaji had acquired extensive lands and wealth through his campaigns, but lacking a formal title, he
				was still technically a Mughal zamindar or the son of a Bijapuri jagirdar, with no legal basis to rule
				his de facto domain. A kingly title could address this and also prevent any challenges by other Maratha
				leaders, to whom he was technically equal.[e] it would also provide the Hindu Marathas with a fellow
				Hindu sovereign in a region otherwise ruled by Muslims.[100]

				The preparation for the proposed coronation began in 1673. However, some controversial problems delayed
				the coronation by almost a year.[101] Controversy erupted amongst the Brahmins of Shivaji's court: they
				refused to crown Shivaji as a king because that status was reserved for those of the kshatriya (warrior)
				varna in Hindu society.[102] Shivaji was descended from a line of headmen of farming villages, and the
				Brahmins accordingly categorised him as being of the shudra (cultivator) varna.[103][104] They noted
				that Shivaji had never had a sacred thread ceremony, and did not wear the thread, which a kshatriya
				would.[103] Shivaji summoned Gaga Bhatt, a pandit of Varanasi, who stated that he had found a genealogy
				proving that Shivaji was descended from the Sisodias, and thus indeed a kshatriya, albeit one in need of
				the ceremonies befitting his rank.[105] To enforce this status, Shivaji was given a sacred thread
				ceremony, and remarried his spouses under the Vedic rites expected of a kshatriya.[106][107] However,
				following historical evidence, Shivaji's claim to Rajput, and specifically Sisodia ancestry may be
				interpreted as being anything from tenuous at best, to inventive in a more extreme reading.[108]

				On 28 May, Shivaji performed penance for not observing Kshatriya rites by his ancestors' and himself for
				so long. Then he was invested by Gaga Bhatt with the sacred thread.[109] On insistence of other
				Brahmins, Gaga Bhatt dropped the Vedic chant and initiated Shivaji in a modified form of the life of the
				twice-born, instead of putting him on a par with the Brahmins. Next day, Shivaji made atonement for the
				sins, deliberate or accidental, committed in his own lifetime.[110] He was weighed separately against
				seven metals including gold, silver and several other articles like fine linen, camphor, salt, sugar
				etc. All these metals and articles along with a lakh of hun were distributed among the Brahmins. But
				even this failed to satisfy the greed of the Brahmins. Two of the learned Brahmins pointed out that
				Shivaji, while conducting his raids, had burnt cities involving the death of Brahmins, cows, women and
				children and he could be cleansed of this sin for a price of Rs. 8,000, and Shivaji paid this
				amount.[110] Total expenditure made for feeding the assemblage, general alms giving, throne and
				ornaments approached 1.5 million Rupees.[111]

				Shivaji was crowned king of the Maratha Empire (Hindawi Swaraj) in a lavish ceremony on 6 June 1674 at
				Raigad fort.[112][113] In the Hindu calendar it was on the 13th day (trayodashi) of the first fortnight
				of the month of Jyeshtha in the year 1596.[114] Gaga Bhatt officiated, pouring water from a gold vessel
				filled with the waters of the seven sacred rivers Yamuna, Indus, Ganges, Godavari, Narmada, Krishna and
				Kaveri over Shivaji's head, and chanted the Vedic coronation mantras. After the ablution, Shivaji bowed
				before Jijabai and touched her feet. Nearly fifty thousand people gathered at Raigad for the
				ceremonies.[115][116] Shivaji was entitled Shakakarta ("founder of an era")[1] and Chhatrapati
				("sovereign"). He also took the title of Haindava Dharmodhhaarak (protector of the Hindu faith)[2] and
				Kshatriya Kulavantas.[117][118][119] Kshatriya is one of the four varnas[f] of Hinduism and kulavantas
				means the 'head of the kula, or race'.[120]

				Shivaji's mother Jijabai died on 18 June 1674. The Marathas summoned Nischal Puri Goswami, a tantrik
				priest, who declared that the original coronation had been held under inauspicious stars, and a second
				coronation was needed. This second coronation on 24 September 1674 had a dual-use, mollifying those who
				still believed that Shivaji was not qualified for the Vedic rites of his first coronation, by performing
				a less-contestable additional ceremony.[121][122][123]

				Conquest of southern India
				Beginning in 1674, the Marathas undertook an aggressive campaign, raiding Khandesh (October), capturing
				Bijapuri Ponda (April 1675), Karwar (mid-year), and Kolhapur (July).[124] In November, the Maratha navy
				skirmished with the Siddis of Janjira, but failed to dislodge them.[125] Having recovered from an
				illness, and taking advantage of a civil war that had broken out between the Deccanis and the Afghans at
				Bijapur, Shivaji raided Athani in April 1676.[126]

				In the run-up to his expedition, Shivaji appealed to a sense of Deccani patriotism, that Southern India
				was a homeland that should be protected from outsiders.[127][128] His appeal was somewhat successful,
				and in 1677 Shivaji visited Hyderabad for a month and entered into a treaty with the Qutubshah of the
				Golkonda sultanate, agreeing to reject his alliance with Bijapur and jointly oppose the Mughals. In
				1677, Shivaji invaded Karnataka with 30,000 cavalry and 40,000 infantry, backed by Golkonda artillery
				and funding.[129] Proceeding south, Shivaji seized the forts of Vellore and Gingee;[130] the latter
				would later serve as a capital of the Marathas during the reign of his son Rajaram I.[131]

				Shivaji intended to reconcile with his half-brother Venkoji (Ekoji I), Shahaji's son by his second wife,
				Tukabai (née Mohite), who ruled Thanjavur (Tanjore) after Shahaji. The initially promising negotiations
				were unsuccessful, so whilst returning to Raigad, Shivaji defeated his half-brother's army on 26
				November 1677 and seized most of his possessions in the Mysore plateau. Venkoji's wife Dipa Bai, whom
				Shivaji deeply respected, took up new negotiations with Shivaji and also convinced her husband to
				distance himself from Muslim advisors. In the end, Shivaji consented to turn over to her and her female
				descendants many of the properties he had seized, with Venkoji consenting to a number of conditions for
				the proper administration of the territories and maintenance of Shahji's memorial (samadhi).

			<h3>Death and succession</h3>
			<p>
				The question of Shivaji's heir-apparent was complicated. Shivaji confined his son to Panhala in 1678,
				only to have the prince escape with his wife and defect to the Mughals for a year. Sambhaji then
				returned home, unrepentant, and was again confined to Panhala.[134]

				Shivaji died around 3–5 April 1680 at the age of 50,[135] on the eve of Hanuman Jayanti. The cause of
				Shivaji's death is disputed. British records states that Shivaji died of bloody flux being sick for 12
				days.[g] In a contemporary work in Portuguese, the Biblioteca Nacional de Lisboa, the recorded cause of
				death of Shivaji is anthrax.[137][138] However, Krishnaji Anant Sabhasad, author of Sabhasad Bakhar, the
				biography of Shivaji has mentioned fever as the cause of death of Shivaji.[139][138] Putalabai, the
				childless eldest of the surviving wives of Shivaji committed sati by jumping into his funeral pyre.
				Another surviving spouse, Sakwarbai, was not allowed to follow suit because she had a young
				daughter.[134] There were also allegations, though doubted by later scholars, that his second wife
				Soyarabai had poisoned him in order to put her 10-year-old son Rajaram on the throne.[140]

				After Shivaji's death, Soyarabai made plans with various ministers of the administration to crown her
				son Rajaram rather than her stepson Sambhaji. On 21 April 1680, ten-year-old Rajaram was installed on
				the throne. However, Sambhaji took possession of Raigad Fort after killing the commander, and on 18 June
				acquired control of Raigad, and formally ascended the throne on 20 July.[141] Rajaram, his wife Janki
				Bai, and mother Soyrabai were imprisoned, and Soyrabai executed on charges of conspiracy that October.

			<h3>Reimagining</h3>
			<p>
				In the mid-19th century, Marathi social reformer Jyotirao Phule wrote his interpretation of the Shivaji
				legend, portraying him as a hero of the shudras and Dalits. Phule sought to use the Shivaji legends to
				undermine the Brahmins he accused of hijacking the narrative, and uplift the lower classes; his 1869
				ballad-form story of Shivaji was met with great hostility by the Brahmin-dominated media.[186] At the
				end of the 19th century, Shivaji's memory was leveraged by the non-Brahmin intellectuals of Bombay, who
				identified as his descendants and through him claimed the kshatriya varna. While some Brahmins rebutted
				this identity, defining them as of the lower shudra varna, other Brahmins recognised the Marathas'
				utility to the Indian independence movement, and endorsed this kshatriya legacy and the significance of
				Shivaji.[187]

				In 1895, Indian nationalist leader Lokmanya Tilak organised what was to be an annual festival to mark
				the birthday of Shivaji.[188] He portrayed Shivaji as the "opponent of the oppressor", with possible
				negative implications concerning the colonial government.[189] Tilak denied any suggestion that his
				festival was anti-Muslim or disloyal to the government, but simply a celebration of a hero.[190] These
				celebrations prompted a British commentator in 1906 to note: "Cannot the annals of the Hindu race point
				to a single hero whom even the tongue of slander will not dare call a chief of dacoits...?"[191]

				One of the first commentators to reappraise the critical British view of Shivaji was M. G. Ranade, whose
				Rise of the Maratha Power (1900) declared Shivaji's achievements as the beginning of modern
				nation-building. Ranade criticised earlier British portrayals of Shivaji's state as "a freebooting
				Power, which thrived by plunder and adventure, and succeeded only because it was the most cunning and
				adventurous ... This is a very common feeling with the readers, who derive their knowledge of these
				events solely from the works of English historians."[192]

				In 1919, Sarkar published the seminal Shivaji and His Times, hailed as the most authoritative biography
				of the king since James Grant Duff's 1826 A History of the Mahrattas. A respected scholar, Sarkar was
				able to read primary sources in Persian, Marathi, and Arabic, but was challenged for his criticism of
				the "chauvinism" of Marathi historians' views of Shivaji.[193] Likewise, though supporters cheered his
				depiction of the killing of Afzal Khan as justified, they decried Sarkar's terming as "murder" the
				killing of the Hindu raja Chandrao More and his clan.
